NestedScenarios v0.1.1
======================

This plugin is based on FixtureScenarios and FixtureScenarioBuilder.
It includes both worlds in just one plugin with some fixes, new features
and Rails 2.2 support.

You can check them at:

== Install

Install NestedScenarios is very easy. It is stored in GitHub, so if you have
never installed a gem via GitHub run the following:

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

Then install the gem:

  sudo gem install josevalim-nested_scenarios

In RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb:

  config.gem "josevalim-nested_scenarios",  :lib => "nested_scenarios", :source => "http://gems.github.com"

If you want it as plugin, just do:

    cd myapp
    git clone git://github.com/josevalim/nested_scenarios.git
    rm -rf vendor/plugins/nested_scenarios/.git

== Why

You may, from time to time, wish to build your fixtures entirely in Ruby.
Doing so has its advantages, such as automatically created join tables
and default attributes.  YAML files, however, bring with them some real
nice features in Rails which are difficult to abandon: transactional fixtures, 
table_name(:key) helpers, and auto-clearing between tests.  How does one get 
the best of both worlds?

== Usage

Using the +scenario+ method within <tt>scenarios.rb</tt> file,
FixtureScenariosBuilder can create your YAML fixture scenarios automatically
at run time from Ruby-created fixtures.

Any file inside the +fixture_path+ called scenarios.rb is loaded to
generating scenarios:

  [RAILS_ROOT]
  +-test/
    +-fixtures/
      +-scenarios.rb

Or: 

  [RAILS_ROOT]
  +-spec/
    +-fixtures/
      +-models/
        +-scenarios.rb
      +-controllers/
        +-scenarios.rb
      +-helpers/
        +-scenarios.rb

Now build your scenarios in those file, wrapping scenarios in the 
+scenario+ method and providing it with the name of your scenario.  
A brief example of a complete <tt>scenarios.rb</tt> file:

  scenario :banned_users do
    %w( Tom Chris Kevin ).each_with_index do |user, index|
      User.create(:name => user, :banned => index.odd?)
    end
  end

Assuming +banned+ is a boolean field, this will create for us:

  [RAILS_ROOT]
  +-test/
    +-fixtures/
      +-banned_users/
        +-users.yml

Our generated <tt>users.yml</tt> file will look something like this:

  chris: 
    name: Chris
    id: "2"
    banned: "1"
    updated_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04
    created_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04
  kevin: 
    name: Kevin
    id: "3"
    banned: "0"
    updated_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04
    created_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04
  tom: 
    name: Tom
    id: "1"
    banned: "0"
    updated_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04
    created_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04

Notice how the keys correspond to the user names. You can register fields that
can be used as fixtures names by:

  NestedScenarios.record_name_fields << :nickname

You can assign your records to instance variables, then call +names_from_ivars+
at the conclusion of your +scenario+ block.

  scenario :foo do
    @small_red_widget = Widget.create(:size => 'small', :color => 'red')
    @big_blue_widget  = Widget.create(:size => 'big',   :color => 'blue')

    names_from_ivars!
  end

The above produces the following YAML:

  small_red_widget:
    size: small
    color: red
    updated_at: 2007-12-27 10:09:05
    created_at: 2007-12-27 10:09:05
  big_blue_widget:
    size: big
    color: blue
    updated_at: 2007-12-27 10:19:23
    created_at: 2007-12-27 10:19:23

To build the scenario you have to run:

  rake db:build:scenario

In NestedScenarios, scenarios are not generated automatically. Another change
is how scenarios are nested:

  scenario :models => { :users => :banned } do
    User.create(:name => 'Kevin', :banned => true)
  end

This will create an YAML in the following dir:

  [RAILS_ROOT]
  +-test/
    +-fixtures/
      +-models/
        +-users/
          +-banned/
            +-users.yml

Finally, you can choose which scenario to use in your tests by:

  scenario :users

Or, in the case of nested scenarios:

  scenario :models => { :users => :banned }

If no scenario is sent, the default behaviour is adopted.
